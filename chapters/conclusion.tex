Our goals were a list of requirements, a look on existing solutions, design the application, the application itself and documentation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the requirements engineering chapter we got together use cases, scenarios, and made a structured document containing requirements.
    \item In chapter existing solutions we came to the conclusion, that there is currently no existing solution to our problem, so we need to create the application.
    \item We designed the UI and chose the architecture pattern for our application.
    \item Application has been implemented and tested.
    \item We wrote documentation for our ETL client.
\end{itemize}

In the future, the application may be improved with a better UI.
Some components are currently not supported and it the future, it could be solved by a cooperation of the application developer(s) and the server developers.
