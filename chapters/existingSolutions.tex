If there already exists a perfect solution which suits my requirements, it doesn't make sense to create it one more time.

\section{Description of existing solutions}

\subsection{Responsive web app}
It works on any device, not just android devices. Users don't have to download it, which also means they don't have to update it. The responsive web app only works with one server instance. On an android device, it responds slower to screen rotation and animations feel laggy. Even if you don't want to execute anything, just view history or list pipelines, you have to be online. It is also browser dependent.
