The goal of this thesis is to pitch an android client for the ETL LinkedPipes system as an alternative to opening a web page in mobile browser.

In order to do that, we need to go through the whole software developing cycle.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The goal of requirements engineering is to get together a list of requirements for the application.
    \item Chapter existing solutions should answer question: "Do we really need to make an application, or is there a ready to use solution for our needs?"
    \item At the end of design chapter, two things should be clear. How the application will look like and how the code will be layered.
    \item Result of the implementation layer will be the application.
    \item After the application is finished, we will write a documentation.
\end{itemize}
