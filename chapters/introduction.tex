LinkedPipes ETL is a system for working with linked data.
It was created in 2016 by students and researchers from Prague computer science universities.
It is an open source project with MIT license, so anyone can use it.
After you setup a server, you can access it via web browser.
It has a support for mobile phones, but it has some drawbacks that we will later write about in this work.
But there is no easy way of managing multiple server instances from one place.

In this work we're going to solve both of those problems at the same time, by making an android application, where you can manage all of your ETL server instances at the same time.
It will provide nice and smooth mobile experience to ETL users, especially to those, who are working with multiple server instances.

We will start by writing down things we expect from the application in the requirements engineering chapter.
Once we know, what we need, we can compare our needs to existing solutions.
When we are sure, that there is no existing solution for our problem, we need to design our application.
We will go through designing parts we can see and users will interact with and then parts that can not be seen, the architecture of the application.
At the end of this chapter, we should know everything we need to know for the implementation.
In the implementation chapter, there will be some interesting stuff that happened during programming the app.
